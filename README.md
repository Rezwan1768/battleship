# üõ≥Ô∏è Battleship

A web-based version of the classic Battleship game. Built from scratch using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Features drag-and-drop ship placement, responsive design, and a single-player experience against a computer opponent that uses strategic targeting.

## Instructions

1. Your board will be displayed on the main screen. You can drag and reposition ships (press 'R' while dragging to rotate the ship). You can also press the **Reposition Ships** button to move them around.

2. Once you're satisfied with your ship positions, press the **Start Game** button to begin.

3. Take turns attacking the computer's board. You win by sinking all of your opponent's ships, and lose if the opponent sinks all of your ships.
